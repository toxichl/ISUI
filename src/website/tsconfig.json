Here are the <a\n                    href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/tilomitra/pure-bliss\">slides from the presentation</a>.\n                Although it looks pretty minimalist, we’ve been working on Pure for several months. After\n                many iterations, we have released Pure as a set of small, responsive, CSS modules that you\n                can use in every web project."
